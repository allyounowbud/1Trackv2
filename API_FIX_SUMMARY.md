# API Endpoint Fixes - Complete Summary

## ✅ **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Double `/v1/` in URLs** ✅ 
The `scrydexHybridService.js` was creating malformed URLs with double `/v1/` paths:
- ❌ Before: `https://api.scrydex.com/v1/pokemon/v1/en/expansions`
- ✅ After: `https://api.scrydex.com/v1/pokemon/en/expansions`

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated base URL construction in `callDirectAPI()` to include `/v1`
- Updated all endpoint paths to remove the redundant `/v1/` prefix

### 2. **Missing scrydexService Import** ✅
The `Search.jsx` file was using `scrydexService` without importing it.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `import scrydexService from '../services/scrydexService';` to `Search.jsx`

### 3. **Incorrect Method Names** ✅
The `Search.jsx` file was calling non-existent methods.

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed `scrydexService.searchCards()` → `scrydexService.searchPokemonCards()`

## 🔧 **Setup Required**

### Set API Credentials for Development

Since you're running in development mode, you need to set your Scrydex API credentials in localStorage:

**Option 1: Use the Setup Page**
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/set-api-credentials.html`
2. Click "Set API Credentials"
3. You'll be automatically redirected to the search page

**Option 2: Manual Setup in Browser Console**
Open your browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('scrydex_api_key', '3afbdca9aaae128736728a33c52b734abda3278545f9406c02c9c91ab0e728a7');
localStorage.setItem('scrydex_team_id', 'onetracking');
```
Then reload the page.

## 🚀 **Testing**

1. **Set the API credentials** using one of the methods above
2. **Reload the page** (`http://localhost:5173/search`)
3. **Check the console** - you should see:
   - ✅ `🔍 Scrydex API call (Direct): /pokemon/expansions`
   - ✅ Successful API responses
   - ✅ No more 404 errors

## 📊 **What to Expect**

After setting the credentials, you should see:

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- Expansions loading successfully
- Card search working
- No 404 errors in console
- API calls showing correct URLs (no double `/v1/`)

### 📝 Console Logs:
```
🔑 API Credentials check: { hasApiKey: true, hasTeamId: true }
🔍 Scrydex API call (Direct): /pokemon/expansions {...}
📡 API Response Status: 200 OK
📊 Scrydex API response: {data: Array(...)}
```

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

Once the API is working in development:

1. **For Production**: Set up environment variables in Supabase Edge Functions
2. **For Data Sync**: Run the sync service to populate Supabase tables
3. **For Performance**: The app will load data from local tables for instant results

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### Still getting 404 errors?
- Make sure you set the API credentials
- Check that the API key and team ID are correct
- Try clearing localStorage and setting credentials again

### API calls not working?
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify the URLs don't have double `/v1/` anymore
- Make sure you're using your actual Scrydex API credentials

### Need to reset?
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('scrydex_api_key');
localStorage.removeItem('scrydex_team_id');
// Then set them again
```
