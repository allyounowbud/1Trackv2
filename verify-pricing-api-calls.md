# Scrydex API Pricing Verification

## üîç **Current API Call Analysis**

### **Current API Calls:**
```typescript
// In scrydex-api/index.ts (line 153)
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  q: searchQuery,
  page: options.page || '1',
  page_size: options.pageSize || '100',
  include: 'prices'  // ‚úÖ This includes pricing data
})

// In scrydex-sync/index.ts (line 321)
const result = await this.makeRequest(`/pokemon/cards/${card.id}`, {
  include: 'prices'  // ‚úÖ This includes pricing data
});
```

## ‚ùì **Question: Does `include: 'prices'` include both raw AND graded pricing?**

Based on the Scrydex documentation and your existing code, the `include: 'prices'` parameter should include both raw and graded pricing data. However, let me verify this is working correctly.

## üîß **Recommended Verification Steps**

### **1. Test API Response Structure**
We should test a specific API call to see exactly what pricing data is returned:

```javascript
// Test API call to see complete response structure
const testResponse = await fetch('https://api.scrydex.com/v1/pokemon/v1/en/cards/sv1-025?include=prices', {
  headers: {
    'X-Api-Key': 'your-api-key',
    'X-Team-ID': 'your-team-id'
  }
});

const data = await testResponse.json();
console.log('Complete API response:', JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
```

### **2. Check if Additional Parameters Are Needed**
Some APIs require specific parameters to get both raw and graded pricing. We might need:

```typescript
// Potential additional parameters
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  q: searchQuery,
  page: options.page || '1',
  page_size: options.pageSize || '100',
  include: 'prices',
  // These might be needed for complete pricing data:
  include_raw: 'true',      // If this parameter exists
  include_graded: 'true',   // If this parameter exists
  pricing_type: 'all'       // If this parameter exists
})
```

### **3. Verify Current Data Structure**
Check what your current API responses actually contain:

```sql
-- Check what pricing data is currently being stored
SELECT 
  api_id,
  raw_market_price,
  raw_low_price,
  graded_market_price,
  graded_low_price,
  graded_grade,
  graded_company,
  prices  -- This should contain the complete API response
FROM cached_cards 
WHERE raw_market_price IS NOT NULL OR graded_market_price IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 5;
```

## üö® **Potential Issues**

### **Issue 1: API Response Structure**
The Scrydex API might return pricing data in a different structure than expected. The current code expects:
- `raw_pricing` object
- `graded_pricing` object

But the API might return:
- `prices.raw` object
- `prices.graded` object
- Or a different structure entirely

### **Issue 2: Missing API Parameters**
The `include: 'prices'` parameter might not include both raw and graded pricing by default. We might need additional parameters.

### **Issue 3: Subscription Level**
Your Scrydex subscription might not include access to both raw and graded pricing data.

## üîß **Recommended Actions**

### **1. Update API Calls to Ensure Complete Pricing Data**
```typescript
// Update the API calls to be more explicit about pricing data
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  q: searchQuery,
  page: options.page || '1',
  page_size: options.pageSize || '100',
  include: 'prices,raw_prices,graded_prices'  // Try multiple include parameters
});
```

### **2. Add Debug Logging**
```typescript
// Add logging to see exactly what pricing data is returned
console.log('üîç API Response pricing structure:', {
  hasPrices: !!data.prices,
  pricesKeys: data.prices ? Object.keys(data.prices) : [],
  hasRawPricing: !!data.raw_pricing,
  hasGradedPricing: !!data.graded_pricing,
  fullResponse: data
});
```

### **3. Test with Known Card**
Test with a specific card that should have both raw and graded pricing to verify the API is returning complete data.

## üìã **Next Steps**

1. **Test Current API Response**: Run a test API call to see the exact structure
2. **Check Subscription**: Verify your Scrydex subscription includes both raw and graded pricing
3. **Update API Calls**: Modify the API calls if additional parameters are needed
4. **Verify Data Storage**: Ensure the database is storing all pricing data correctly

Would you like me to help you test the current API response structure to see exactly what pricing data is being returned?
