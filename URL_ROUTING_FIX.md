# URL Routing Fix - Dynamic URLs Like Scrydex

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

Your app's URL always stayed at `/search` no matter what page you were on, making it impossible to:
- ✅ Bookmark specific expansions
- ✅ Share direct links to card sets
- ✅ Navigate back/forward with browser buttons
- ✅ Have clean, readable URLs

**Scrydex Example:**
```
https://scrydex.com/pokemon/expansions/mega-evolution/me1
```

**Your App (Before):**
```
http://localhost:3000/search  (always the same)
```

---

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Added Dynamic Routes**

**File:** `src/App.jsx`

```javascript
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Collection />} />
  <Route path="/search" element={<SearchApi />} />
  <Route path="/search/:game" element={<SearchApi />} />
  <Route path="/search/:game/expansions/:expansionId" element={<SearchApi />} />
  <Route path="/shipments" element={<Shipments />} />
  <Route path="/analytics" element={<Analytics />} />
  <Route path="/orders" element={<Orders />} />
  <Route path="/settings" element={<Settings />} />
</Routes>
```

### **2. Updated SearchApi to Use URL Params**

**File:** `src/pages/SearchApi.jsx`

```javascript
import { useNavigate, useParams, useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';

const SearchApi = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const { game: gameParam, expansionId: expansionParam } = useParams();
  const location = useLocation();
  // ...
}
```

### **3. Navigation Updates URL**

**Game Selection:**
```javascript
const handleGameSelect = async (game) => {
  // ...
  navigate(`/search/${game.id}`);
}
```

**Expansion Selection:**
```javascript
const handleExpansionSelect = async (expansion) => {
  navigate(`/search/${selectedGame.id}/expansions/${expansion.id}`);
  // ...
}
```

**Back Navigation:**
```javascript
const handleBackToGames = () => {
  // ...
  navigate('/search');
};

const handleBackToExpansions = () => {
  // ...
  navigate(`/search/${selectedGame.id}`);
};
```

### **4. URL Sync with State**

```javascript
// Sync URL params with app state
useEffect(() => {
  const syncUrlWithState = async () => {
    if (!servicesInitialized) return;

    // If we have a game param, set the selected game
    if (gameParam && gameParam !== 'other') {
      const game = games.find(g => g.id === gameParam);
      if (game && game.id !== selectedGame?.id) {
        setSelectedGame(game);
        
        // If we have an expansion param, find and select it
        if (expansionParam) {
          setCurrentView('search');
          const expansion = expansions.find(e => e.id === expansionParam);
          if (expansion && expansion.id !== selectedExpansion?.id) {
            setSelectedExpansion(expansion);
            await performExpansionSearch(expansion.id, 1, false, null, true, filterValues);
          }
        } else {
          setCurrentView('expansions');
        }
      }
    } else if (!gameParam) {
      // No params - show games view
      if (currentView !== 'games' && currentView !== 'manual') {
        setCurrentView('games');
      }
    }
  };

  syncUrlWithState();
}, [gameParam, expansionParam, servicesInitialized]);
```

## 🔧 **URL Structure**

### **Your App Now Has:**

| Page | URL Example |
|------|-------------|
| Search Home | `/search` |
| Pokemon Game | `/search/pokemon` |
| Lorcana Game | `/search/lorcana` |
| Magic Game | `/search/magic` |
| Expansion View | `/search/pokemon/expansions/me1` |
| Other Products | `/search/other` |

### **Comparison with Scrydex:**

| Scrydex | Your App |
|---------|----------|
| `/pokemon/expansions/mega-evolution/me1` | `/search/pokemon/expansions/me1` |
| `/lorcana/expansions/reign-of-jafar/rj1` | `/search/lorcana/expansions/rj1` |

**Note:** Your URLs are slightly different but follow the same pattern. You include `/search` as the base path since it's part of your app's navigation structure.

---

## 🎯 **Benefits**

### **1. Bookmarking**
Users can bookmark specific pages:
```
/search/pokemon/expansions/me1  → Mega Evolution expansion
/search/lorcana                 → Lorcana game view
```

### **2. Sharing**
Share direct links to specific content:
```
"Check out this expansion!"
→ /search/pokemon/expansions/sv1
```

### **3. Browser Navigation**
- ✅ Back button works correctly
- ✅ Forward button works correctly
- ✅ Browser history is preserved

### **4. Deep Linking**
Navigate directly to content from external links or bookmarks

---

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### **1. Test Game Selection**
1. Open your app at `/search`
2. Click "Pokémon"
3. URL should change to `/search/pokemon`
4. Browser back button should return to `/search`

### **2. Test Expansion Selection**
1. Navigate to `/search/pokemon`
2. Click "Mega Evolution" expansion
3. URL should change to `/search/pokemon/expansions/me1`
4. Browser back button should return to `/search/pokemon`

### **3. Test Direct URL**
1. Close your app
2. Navigate directly to `/search/pokemon/expansions/me1`
3. App should load the Mega Evolution expansion
4. Cards should display automatically

### **4. Test Bookmarking**
1. Navigate to any expansion
2. Bookmark the page (Ctrl+D)
3. Close the app
4. Open the bookmark
5. Should load the exact same expansion

✅ Can bookmark any page
✅ Can share direct links to expansions
✅ Browser back/forward works correctly
✅ Deep linking works from external sources
```

      → Cards load automatically
```

🎊 **Your app now has proper URL routing like Scrydex!** 🎊

## 🔍 **Technical Notes**

### **React Router:**
- Uses `useParams()` to read URL parameters
- Uses `useNavigate()` to update URLs programmatically
- Uses `useLocation()` for location awareness

### **URL Synchronization:**
- `useEffect` watches `gameParam` and `expansionParam`
- Syncs URL state with React state
- Handles deep linking on initial load

### **Navigation Flow:**
```
User clicks game
  → handleGameSelect()
    → navigate(`/search/${game.id}`)
      → URL updates
        → useEffect detects change
          → Updates React state
            → UI updates
```

---

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### **If URLs don't update:**
1. Check that you're using `navigate()` in handlers
2. Verify routes are defined in `App.jsx`
3. Make sure `useParams()` is destructuring correctly

### **If direct links don't work:**
1. Check the URL sync `useEffect` is running
2. Verify `servicesInitialized` is true
3. Check that expansions have loaded

### **If browser back/forward doesn't work:**
1. Make sure you're using `navigate()` not `window.location`
2. Verify React Router is configured correctly
3. Check that state updates are happening
