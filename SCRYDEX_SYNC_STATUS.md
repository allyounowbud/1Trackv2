# Scrydex API Sync Status

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. Database Setup
- ✅ **394 Pokemon expansions** successfully stored
- ✅ **14,200 Pokemon cards** successfully stored with correct image URLs
- ✅ Database schema is properly configured with all necessary tables

### 2. API Integration
- ✅ **Scrydex API authentication** working correctly
- ✅ **Image URLs** are being stored properly using `card.images[0].small` and `card.images[0].large`
- ✅ **Expansion data** is correctly mapped using `card.expansion.id` and `card.expansion.name`
- ✅ **Pricing data** is being fetched with `?include=prices` parameter

### 3. Data Structure
- ✅ **21,438 total cards** available in the API
- ✅ **All cards have variants** with pricing data structure
- ✅ **Pricing extraction logic** is working correctly

## ⚠️ What Needs to be Fixed

### 1. Database Constraint Issue
**Problem**: The `card_prices` table is missing a unique constraint on `card_id`, preventing upsert operations.

**Solution**: Run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard:
```sql
ALTER TABLE card_prices ADD CONSTRAINT card_prices_card_id_unique UNIQUE (card_id);
```

### 2. Complete Data Sync
**Current Status**: 
- 14,200 cards stored (out of 21,438 total)
- 0 pricing records stored

**Next Steps**:
1. Fix the database constraint (above)
2. Run the complete sync to get all remaining cards and pricing data

## 🚀 How to Complete the Setup

### Step 1: Fix Database Constraint
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Open the SQL Editor
3. Run the SQL from `scripts/fix-database-constraints.sql`

### Step 2: Complete the Data Sync
```bash
npm run fetch-scrydex-data
```

This will:
- Fetch the remaining ~7,000 cards
- Extract and store pricing data for all cards
- Update sync status

### Step 3: Verify the Results
```bash
npm run resume-sync
```

This will show you the final statistics.

## 📊 Expected Final Results

After completion, you should have:
- **21,438 Pokemon cards** with images and all metadata
- **394 Pokemon expansions** with logos and symbols
- **Pricing data** for cards that have it available
- **Instant loading** in your web app from local database

## 🔧 Available Scripts

- `npm run fetch-scrydex-data` - Complete data sync
- `npm run resume-sync` - Check status and extract pricing
- `npm run fetch-pricing` - Fetch pricing only (if needed)

## 🎯 Next Steps for Your App

1. **Complete the sync** (fix constraint + run fetch)
2. **Test your web app** - it should now show all cards with images
3. **Set up daily pricing sync** (optional, for keeping prices updated)

Your Pokemon app is very close to being fully functional with real Scrydex data!
