# Integrated Game Architecture - Updated Implementation

## Overview

The application has been updated to use a seamless integration where the existing `/search` page acts as the game selector, and clicking a game navigates to its dedicated page. This keeps the familiar user flow while using the new separated architecture under the hood.

## What Changed (User Perspective)

### Before
- Multiple navigation items (Collection, Games, Search, etc.)
- Separate "Games" page

### After
- Cleaner navigation (Collection, Search, Shipments, Settings)
- `/search` shows all TCGs (game selector)
- Clicking a game (e.g., Pokemon) navigates to `/pokemon` (dedicated page)
- Same familiar search bar and UI

## User Flow

```
User clicks "Search" in navigation
    ↓
Sees all TCGs on /search page
    ↓
Clicks Pokemon
    ↓
Navigates to /pokemon (dedicated Pokemon page)
    ↓
Browse sets, search cards, all Pokemon features
```

## Technical Architecture

### Routes

```javascript
// Main routes
/search                          → SearchApi (shows game selector)
/search/:game                    → SearchApi (legacy route)
/search/:game/expansions/:id     → SearchApi (legacy route)

// Game-specific routes
/pokemon                         → PokemonPage (uses pokemonGameService)
/pokemon/expansions/:id          → PokemonPage (specific set)

// Future game routes
/magic                           → MagicPage (when implemented)
/lorcana                         → LorcanaPage (when implemented)
```

### Code Changes

#### 1. SearchApi.jsx
**Added imports:**
```javascript
import { getGameService, hasGameService } from '../services/games/gameServiceFactory';
import { getGameById } from '../config/gamesConfig';
```

**Updated game click handler:**
```javascript
const handleGameClick = (game) => {
  if (game.id === 'pokemon') {
    navigate(`/pokemon`); // Navigate to dedicated page
  } else if (hasGameService(game.id)) {
    navigate(`/${game.id}`); // For other implemented games
  } else {
    // Show coming soon message
  }
};
```

#### 2. Navigation Components
**Removed "Games" menu item from:**
- `BottomNavigation.jsx` (mobile)
- `DesktopSidebar.jsx` (desktop)

**Result:**
- Cleaner navigation
- Search acts as game selector
- No redundant menu items

#### 3. App.jsx Routes
**Removed:**
- `/games` route
- `Games` component import

**Kept:**
- `/search` for game selector
- `/pokemon` for Pokemon-specific page
- Legacy routes for backward compatibility

#### 4. Deleted Files
- `src/pages/Games.jsx` (no longer needed)

### Service Architecture (Unchanged)

The powerful service layer from before is still in place:

```
src/services/games/
├── baseGameService.js          ✅ Base class for all games
├── pokemonGameService.js       ✅ Pokemon implementation
├── gameServiceFactory.js       ✅ Service router
└── ...                         🔄 Add more games here
```

**Benefits of keeping this:**
- Clean separation of game logic
- Easy to add new games
- Better performance and maintainability
- Game-specific optimizations

## How It Works

### 1. Search Page (Game Selector)
When user visits `/search`:
- Shows all available TCGs with logos
- Displays "Coming Soon" for disabled games
- User clicks a game card

### 2. Navigation to Game Page
When user clicks Pokemon:
```javascript
// In SearchApi.jsx handleGameClick
navigate(`/pokemon`);
```

### 3. Pokemon Page
- Uses `pokemonGameService` under the hood
- Shows Pokemon-specific UI
- Browse sets, search cards, view pricing
- All features optimized for Pokemon

### 4. Adding New Games
When Magic or Lorcana are ready:

**Step 1:** Already done - service layer exists
**Step 2:** Create page component (copy Pokemon pattern)
**Step 3:** Add route in App.jsx
**Step 4:** Enable in gamesConfig.js

3. Clicks Pokemon card
4. Navigates to `/pokemon`
5. Sees Pokemon sets
6. Clicks a set
7. Navigates to `/pokemon/expansions/123`
