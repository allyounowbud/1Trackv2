# Partial Sales Implementation - Complete Guide

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully migrated from boolean `is_sold` tracking to **quantity-based partial sale support**. This allows users to sell portions of their orders while maintaining accurate inventory and profit tracking.

---

## ✨ What Changed

### **Before (Boolean Approach)**
- ❌ `is_sold`: true/false flag
- ❌ Could only mark entire order as sold
- ❌ No partial sale support
- ❌ Data sync issues between `is_sold` and `quantity_sold`

### **After (Quantity-Based Approach)**
- ✅ `quantity_sold`: Number of items sold (0 to total quantity)
- ✅ Supports partial sales (sell some, keep rest in collection)
- ✅ Single source of truth - no sync issues
- ✅ Optimized with database indexes for large-scale performance

---

## 📊 How It Works

### **Three Order States**

1. **On Hand** (Not Sold)
   - `quantity_sold = 0` or `NULL`
   - Shows in Collection view
   - Can be marked for sale

2. **Partially Sold**
   - `0 < quantity_sold < quantity`
   - Shows in **both** Collection AND Sold Items views
   - Collection shows remaining quantity
   - Sold Items shows quantity sold
   - Can continue selling remaining items

3. **Fully Sold**
   - `quantity_sold >= quantity`
   - Only shows in Sold Items view
   - Hidden from Collection

---

## 🗂️ Files Modified

### **Database Migration**
- ✅ `migrate-to-quantity-based-sales.sql`
  - Migrates existing `is_sold` data to `quantity_sold`
  - Adds performance indexes on `quantity` and `quantity_sold`
  - Creates `is_fully_sold` computed column (backward compatible)
  - Updates views with quantity-based logic
  - Creates convenience views (`orders_on_hand`, `orders_sold`, etc.)

- ✅ `create-mark-order-sold-function.sql`
  - Database function for marking orders as sold
  - Handles partial sales with validation
  - Calculates profit correctly for partial sales
  - Prevents overselling (quantity_sold > quantity)

### **Frontend Utilities**
- ✅ `src/utils/orderStatus.js` (NEW)
  - Centralized order status logic
  - Helper functions for all components:
    - `getRemainingCount(order)` - Items left to sell
    - `getSoldCount(order)` - Items already sold
    - `hasItemsRemaining(order)` - Boolean check
    - `hasItemsSold(order)` - Boolean check
    - `getSaleStatus(order)` - Returns 'on_hand', 'partially_sold', or 'fully_sold'
    - `getStatusDisplayText(order)` - Human-readable status
    - `filterOnHandOrders(orders)` - Filter for collection view
    - `filterSoldOrders(orders)` - Filter for sold items view

### **UI Components Updated**
- ✅ `src/pages/Collection.jsx`
  - Updated filtering logic to use quantity-based helpers
  - Collection stats now use `getRemainingCount()`
  - Profit calculations handle partial sales
  - Chart data uses remaining quantity
  - "Mark as Sold" modal shows partial sale status
  - Validates against remaining quantity (not total)

- ✅ `src/pages/Orders.jsx`
  - Order status uses quantity comparison
  - Supports 'partial' status in addition to 'sold' and 'on_hand'

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### **1. Smart Filtering**
```javascript
// Collection View - Shows orders with items remaining
const onHandOrders = filterOnHandOrders(orders);
// Returns: orders where quantity_sold < quantity

// Sold Items View - Shows orders with items sold
const soldOrders = filterSoldOrders(orders);
// Returns: orders where quantity_sold > 0

// Both views can show the same order if partially sold!
```

### **2. Accurate Calculations**
```javascript
// Market value only counts unsold items
const remainingQty = getRemainingCount(order);
const marketValue = order.market_value_cents * remainingQty;

// Profit accounts for what's sold vs. what remains
const soldCount = getSoldCount(order);
const profit = soldCount > 0 ? order.net_profit_cents : unrealizedProfit;
```

### **3. Partial Sale UI**
When marking an order as sold that has already been partially sold:
- 🟡 Shows alert: "Partially sold: X of Y already sold"
- Shows remaining quantity available
- Validates max quantity to prevent overselling
- Updates `quantity_sold` incrementally

### **4. Database Performance**
```sql
-- Indexes for fast filtering (even with millions of orders)
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_quantity ON orders(quantity);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_quantity_sold ON orders(quantity_sold);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_quantity_status ON orders(quantity, quantity_sold);

-- Computed column for backward compatibility
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN is_fully_sold BOOLEAN 
  GENERATED ALWAYS AS (quantity_sold >= quantity) STORED;
```

## 📝 Example Usage

### **Scenario: Bought 10 Charizards, Sold 4**

**Initial Purchase:**
```javascript
{
  item_name: "Charizard",
  quantity: 10,
  quantity_sold: 0,
  price_per_item_cents: 5000 // $50 each
}
```

**After Selling 4:**
```javascript
{
  item_name: "Charizard",
  quantity: 10,
  quantity_sold: 4,
  price_per_item_cents: 5000,
  sale_price_per_item_cents: 6000, // Sold at $60 each
  net_profit_cents: 4000 // ($60 - $50) × 4 = $40 profit
}
```

**What Users See:**

*Collection View:*
- Quantity: 6 remaining
- Status: 🟡 Partial (4/10 sold)
- Value: $300 (6 × $50)
- Can sell more

*Sold Items View:*
- Quantity Sold: 4
- Sale Price: $240 total
- Profit: $40 (+16.7%)

## 🔄 Migration Steps

### **For Existing Installations:**

1. **Run Database Migration**
   ```bash
   # In Supabase SQL Editor
   # 1. Run: migrate-to-quantity-based-sales.sql
   # 2. Run: create-mark-order-sold-function.sql
   ```

2. **Verify Data**
   ```sql
   -- Check migration results
   SELECT 
     COUNT(*) as total_orders,
     COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE quantity_sold = 0) as on_hand,
     COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE quantity_sold > 0 AND quantity_sold < quantity) as partial,
     COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE quantity_sold >= quantity) as fully_sold
   FROM orders;
   ```

3. **Deploy Frontend**
   - All frontend changes are included
   - No additional configuration needed
   - Backward compatible with existing data

---

2. **Accuracy**: See exactly what's left in your collection
3. **Tracking**: Monitor partial sales and remaining inventory
4. **History**: Maintain complete purchase and sale records

### **For Scale:**
1. **Performance**: Database indexes ensure fast queries even with millions of orders

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create an order with quantity 10
- [ ] Mark 3 as sold
  - [ ] Verify 7 remaining show in Collection
  - [ ] Verify 3 sold show in Sold Items
  - [ ] Verify order appears in both views
- [ ] Mark 7 more as sold (complete the sale)
  - [ ] Verify order disappears from Collection
  - [ ] Verify order shows 10/10 sold in Sold Items
- [ ] Try to sell more than remaining (should fail validation)
- [ ] Check profit calculations are correct for partial sales
- [ ] Verify collection stats (total value, profit) are accurate

---

## 🎨 UI Updates

### **Collection View**
- Uses `getRemainingCount()` for display quantity
- Shows partial sale indicator: 🟡
- Filters using `filterOnHandOrders()`

### **Sold Items View** (Coming Soon)
- Will use `filterSoldOrders()` 
- Shows quantity sold from each order
- Displays actual profit for sold items

### **Mark as Sold Modal**
- Shows remaining quantity
- Displays partial sale warning if applicable
- Validates against remaining (not total)
- Auto-calculates per-item prices

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Quantity-based tracking opens up possibilities:

1. **Reserve/Hold Quantity**: Track items on hold for potential buyers
2. **Consignment Tracking**: Monitor items sent to consignment shops
3. **Bulk Operations**: Sell multiple partial orders at once
4. **Sale History**: Track each individual sale transaction
5. **Return Handling**: Decrease quantity_sold if items are returned

---

## 📚 Developer Notes

### **Important Patterns**

**Always use helper functions:**
```javascript
// ❌ DON'T DO THIS
if (order.is_sold) { ... }
if (order.quantity_sold === order.quantity) { ... }

// ✅ DO THIS
if (hasItemsSold(order)) { ... }
if (!hasItemsRemaining(order)) { ... }
```

**Use effective quantity for calculations:**
```javascript
// For collection view (remaining items)
const qty = getRemainingCount(order);

// For sold items view (sold items)
const qty = getSoldCount(order);

// Then use it
const value = order.market_value_cents * qty;
```

### **Database Queries**

The views handle most complexity:
```sql
-- Already filtered by user and includes computed fields
SELECT * FROM individual_orders_clean;

-- Pre-filtered convenience views
SELECT * FROM orders_on_hand;    -- Has items remaining
SELECT * FROM orders_sold;        -- Has items sold
SELECT * FROM orders_partially_sold;  -- Partial sales only
```
